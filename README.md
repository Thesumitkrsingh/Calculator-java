## README: Calculator Project

### Purpose
This project is a simple calculator implemented in Java. It demonstrates basic input/output operations using the `Scanner` class, conditional statements for decision-making, and logical operators for evaluating expressions.

### Learning Objectives
* **Input/Output Operations:**
  * Using the `Scanner` class to read user input from the console.
  * Formatting output using string concatenation and placeholders.
* **Conditional Statements:**
  * Employing `if-else` statements to make decisions based on conditions.
  * Utilizing nested `if-else` statements for more complex logic.
* **Logical Operators:**
  * Applying logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to combine conditions.
  * Understanding the precedence of logical operators.

### Usage
1. **Compile the code:**
   * Open a terminal or command prompt.
   * Navigate to the directory where the Java source code file (`Calculator.java`) is located.
   * Use the following command to compile the code:
     ```bash
     javac Calculator.java
     ```

2. **Run the program:**
   * Execute the compiled class file:
     ```bash
     java Calculator
     ```
   * The program will prompt you to enter two numbers and an operation.
   * Enter the desired values and the program will display the result.

### Code Structure
The `Calculator.java` file contains the following:
* **Import statement:** Imports the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package.
* **Main method:**
  * Creates a `Scanner` object to read user input.
  * Prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operation.
  * Uses conditional statements to determine the appropriate calculation based on the user's input.
  * Displays the result.

### Additional Notes
* **Error handling:** Consider adding error handling to validate user input and handle invalid operations.
* **Enhancements:** You can extend this project by adding more operations, implementing a user-friendly interface, or using a loop to allow for multiple calculations.
* **Learning resources:** Refer to Java tutorials and documentation for further exploration of input/output, conditional statements, and logical operators.

By completing this project, you will have gained a solid understanding of fundamental Java concepts and be well-prepared to tackle more complex programming tasks.
